# GraphQL types

We can use `yarn codegen` to automatically generate types for our GraphQL queries and mutations. See [the Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/recipes/static-typing.html) for details.

The autogenerated types live in `src/generated`, but they're not named very well. Interface names don't start with an I, and the names are very generic -- which means conflicts when you import them into a component.

For this reason, we keep the custom parameterized types in this directory. This means that we can import e.g. `<SignupMutation>` instead of writing `class SignupMutation extends Mutation<signup, signupVariables>` in the component file.
